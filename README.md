Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
It is the systematic approach to designing, developing, testing and maintaining software applications using engineering principles.
It is important as it ensures high quality software that meets user needs, helps manage complex software projects and reduces deveopment costs and time using structured methods . 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Development of structured programmming replacing spaghetti code that was disorganized ad took a lot of time in developing.

The Rise of Object-Oriented Programming whereby Instead of writing long, repetitive code, developers started using objects (code blocks that represent real-world things)which led to languages like C++, Java, and Python made coding more reusable, scalable, and efficient.

The Agile Revolution-Before Agile, software was made using Waterfall, a slow, rigid method that was replaced by the Agile Manifesto, focusing on flexibility, teamwork, and fast updates leading to quick, efficient development.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Planning ; Identify the project's purpose, objectives, and feasibility.
Requirement Analysis ; Gather and document what the software must do.
Design ; Create system architecture, UI/UX, and database structure.
Implementation (Coding) ; Developers write and test code based on design.
Testing ; Check for bugs, errors, and security issues before deployment.
Deployment ; Release the software for users (can be phased or all at once).
Maintenance ; Fix bugs, update features, and improve performance over time.



Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology has a step by step approach thus it can be used in government and medical software while agile methodology has a flexible approach thus it is used in startups and mobile apps where feedback is frequent.
waterfall methodology is hard to change or adapt while agile methodology is easy to adapt.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer; Writes, tests and maintains the code.
Quality assuarance engineer; Tests software for bugs anf ensures full functionality.
Project manager; Oversees the planning, execution and communication of the teams.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments provide too;s for debugging, syntax error highlighting and auto complesion increasing efficiency.
Version control systems track changes, enable collaboration and prevent code loss.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Complexity in management of software which can be solved by using modular programming as breaking tasks into small parts is easier.
Extremely tight deadlines which can be helped by using agile sprints for efficient task management.
Constant evolution of technology which can be solved by continous learning of courses and reading documents.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing ; Tests individual components .
Integration Testing; Checks if different parts work together.
System Testing; Tests the whole system as a user would.
Acceptance Testing; Confirms the software meets business requirements before release.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of crafting inputs (prompts) to get the best responses from AI models like ChatGPT.
It is Important because:
It improves AI generated results.
It makes AI more efficient in answering questions.
It helps developers build better AI applications.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt; "Tell me about space."

Improved Prompt; "Explain the formation of black holes in simple terms, and include real-world examples."

Why is it better?
Specific (Black holes, not just “space”).
Clear (Wants an explanation, not just facts).
Concise (No unnecessary words).
